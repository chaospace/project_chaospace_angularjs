One solution is 3D laser scanning and modelling.

        <p><b>Accurate project design and resource efficiency<br></b>One of our largest pharmaceutical customers has initiated a project involving the reconstruction and replacement of the refrigeration plant, ventilation systems, BMS and electrical supplies at a 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> factory.</p>
        <p>As part of the project, the old ventilation systems will be lifted out of the 5 technical rooms in the factory and replaced with fewer and larger plants on the roof. Simultaneously, the solution will provide the customer with modern, energy-efficient equipment and free more space in the technical rooms.</p>
        <p>At the same time a new refrigeration plant will be established, a number of old building services on the roof will be demolished, and pipes and cables will be run from the new plants down to the technical rooms. One of the challenges is to stay clear of existing refrigeration systems, piping and roof light installations, etc.</p>
        <p>Due to the complexity of the project, traditional measurement and data registration methods would have been highly time-consuming. The use of 3D laser scanning and modelling has helped to ensure a quick and smooth process. A detailed mapping of existing and future building services has facilitated the planning and coordination processes significantly, resulting in reduced costs in terms of time and money.</p>
        <p><b>3D scanning and modelling in practice</b>
            <br>The task has been carried out in cooperation with a subcontractor specializing in laser scans. Using scans from 15 measuring points, the entire roof and all the building services have been mapped down to the smallest detail (+ / – 2 mm) in a so-called point cloud. The laser scanner also took visual images for 3D modelling.</p>

        <p>By converting data from the photo images and the point cloud into 3D objects such as roofs, hoods, refrigeration and ventilation plants, we created a complete 3D model of the building and the roof showing both existing and future building services. It was then easy to design the new plants on the roof while taking the existing facilities into account<b>.</b></p>
        <p><b>Scanning</b><b> facilitates prefabrication<br></b>3D scanning and modelling was also used on a technical floor of approx. 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> where existing ducts to the production areas will be connected to the new manifold and ducts running from the roof. This task required a scan head with a finer resolution, and accurate 3D scans have made it possible to prefabricate ducts and adapters externally so that the building services can be implemented quickly with minimal disruption to the production.</p>

        <p><b>Laser scanning pays off<br></b>While 3D laser scanning is a resource-intensive method, the investment can pay for itself in man-hours saved on measuring, registration and design processes. The method ensures that all essential data are registered quickly, efficiently, and with great accuracy. It shortens the process between idea and implementation, making it easier to plan and coordinate the work in the project design phase. At ALECTIA, we have positive experiences in using the tool, which is more and more commonly used.</p>
        <p><b>From conceptual design to site supervision<br></b>As full-service consultant, ALECTIA has handled the project all the way from conceptual and basic design to detailed design and tender. In the ongoing implementation phase, which is expected to run throughout 2014, we are responsible for construction management, security management and technical supervision.</p>
